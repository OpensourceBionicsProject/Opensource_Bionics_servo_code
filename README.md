This repository contains example Arduino code and files for controlling a prosthetic hand developed as part of the OpenSource Bionics project.

Three different input methods are demonstrated:

    Potentiometer-based control – for smooth, analog-style hand movement.

    Button-based control – for basic open/close action with a single button.

    Muscle sensor-based control – using the AD8232 muscle activity sensor for intuitive, EMG-based input.
